abstract: |
  India has devised innovative strategies to reduce the spread of COVID-19 within the constraints of a low-resource setting. India has also made some questionable policy decisions. Lessons learned from the Indian experience for public health, health care, and data infrastructure can be globally valuable. In this commentary, as a team of public health data scientists engaged in modeling the pandemic since early 2020, we reflect on India9s journey over the past 1 year.
