  Query by Humming (QBH) is a system to provide a user with the song(s) which the user hums to the system. Current QBH method requires the extraction of onset and pitch information in order to track similarity with various versions of different songs. However, we here focus on detecting precise onsets only and use them to build a QBH system which is better than existing methods in terms of speed and memory and empirically in terms of accuracy. We also provide statistical analogy for onset detection functions and provide a measure of error in our algorithm.
