  abstract = {False negative rates of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 diagnostic tests, together with selection bias due to prioritized testing can result in inaccurate modeling of COVID‐19 transmission dynamics based on reported “case” counts. We propose an extension of the widely used Susceptible‐Exposed‐Infected‐Removed (SEIR) model that accounts for misclassification error and selection bias, and derive an analytic expression for the basic reproduction number R 0 as a function of false negative rates of the diagnostic tests and}
