  abstract = {There has been much discussion and debate around the underreporting of COVID-19 infections and deaths in India. In this short report we first estimate this underreporting factor for infections from publicly available data released by the Indian Council of Medical Research from national seroprevalence surveys. We then use a rigorous compartmental epidemiologic model to estimate the undetected number of infections and deaths. We compare the serosurvey-based ad hoc estimates with the model-based estimates.
