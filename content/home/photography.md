During the fall of 2022, I had the incredible opportunity to visit Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire. The trip coincided with the enchanting fall season, where nature painted the landscape with a mesmerizing palette of autumn hues. Although we arrived slightly before the peak time for bright red foliage, we were still treated to a breathtaking display of colors. The hills surrounding the lake were adorned with shades of orange, yellow, light green, and vermillion, creating a stunning tapestry of fall foliage. It was a sight to behold and a testament to the beauty of nature's artistry. Exploring the area with my camera allowed me to capture these moments and share them with you. I hope these photos convey the essence of that magical trip and evoke a sense of the vibrant fall atmosphere at Lake Winnipesaukee.

In December 2019, I was captivated by a breathtaking sunset in the Thar Desert, Rajasthan, India. The sky underwent a magical transformation from light yellow to golden, then to vibrant orange, fiery scarlet, and finally a deep red before succumbing to the evening's darkness. The fine dust in the air, lifted from the golden dunes, caught the sun's rays, creating an ethereal light that was a photographer's dream.

This sunset was the grand finale of my memorable trip to Rajasthan, filled with explorations of majestic palaces and historical museums. Shared with my college mates, it was one of our last trips before the world paused due to the pandemic. I captured these moments in my camera, each photograph a testament to this grand spectacle. As I share these images on my website, I hope they transport you to that magical evening in the Thar Desert.
