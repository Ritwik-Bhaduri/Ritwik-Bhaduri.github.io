I am a Ph.D. student at the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/home), [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu) where I work with [Prof Lucas Janson](https://http://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu/) on model free high dimensional inference. Before joining Harvard, I completed B.Stat (Hons.) and M.Stat from [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/home). In the summer of 2020 and 2021, I worked with [Dr. Bhramar Mukherjee](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/mukherjee-bhramar.html), chair of dept. of Biostatistics, [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/). Most of the papers and software from this collaboration can be found at [covind19.org](https://umich-biostatistics.shinyapps.io/covid19/).
