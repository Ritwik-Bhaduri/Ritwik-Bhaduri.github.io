  abstract = {Changepoint detection is the problem of finding abrupt or gradual changes in time series data when the distribution of the time series changes significantly. There are many sophisticated statistical algorithms for solving changepoint detection problem, although there is not much work devoted towards gradual changepoints as compared to abrupt ones. Here we present a new approach to solve the changepoint detection problem using the fuzzy rough set theory which is able to detect such gradual changepoints. An expression for}
